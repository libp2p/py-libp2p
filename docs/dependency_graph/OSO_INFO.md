# Open Source Observer (OSO)

## What is OSO?

**Open Source Observer (OSO)** is an open-source, AI-driven data platform designed to help organizations and developers understand and analyze open source projects. It provides tools for tracking metrics, dependencies, and ecosystem health.

## Key Features

### 1. **Project Analytics**

- Track project health and activity
- Monitor contributor engagement
- Analyze code quality and maintenance
- Measure project adoption and usage

### 2. **Dependency Analysis**

- Visualize dependency graphs
- Track dependency health and security
- Understand project dependencies and their relationships
- Identify transitive dependencies and potential vulnerabilities

### 3. **Ecosystem Insights**

- Understand how projects fit into larger ecosystems
- Track project interdependencies
- Analyze community health
- Measure impact and adoption

### 4. **Data Platform**

- Public data warehouse with open source project data
- AI-powered semantic layer for conversational analysis
- Predictive models for growth and sustainability
- Integration with various data sources

## Who Uses OSO?

- **Ethereum Foundation** - Informs funding decisions
- **Optimism Collective** - Understands ROI of capital allocation
- **Open source maintainers** - Track project health
- **Developers** - Evaluate dependencies and project quality
- **Organizations** - Make data-driven decisions about open source adoption

## OSO and Dependency Graphs

OSO can ingest dependency graph data (like the JSON format we generated) to:

- Visualize project dependencies
- Track dependency health over time
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Understand ecosystem relationships
- Measure project complexity

## Resources

- **Website**: https://www.oso.xyz/
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/opensource-observer/oso
- **Documentation**: Check the GitHub repository for API documentation and integration guides

## How Our Dependency Graphs Help

The dependency graphs we generated (`dependencies.json` and `dependencies_transitive.json`) can be:

1. **Uploaded to OSO** - For visualization and analysis
1. **Used with OSO's API** - To track dependency metrics over time
1. **Integrated into OSO's data warehouse** - For ecosystem-wide analysis
1. **Used for security analysis** - To identify vulnerable dependencies

## Next Steps

To integrate with OSO:

1. Check OSO's documentation for API endpoints
1. Upload the JSON dependency graph files
1. Use OSO's tools to visualize and analyze py-libp2p's dependencies
1. Track dependency health and security over time
