# Observability Docs

This directory is the primary documentation location for OSO-backed
maintainer observability in `py-libp2p`.

## Contents

- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: package-first layout and ownership boundaries
- `OSO_INTEGRATION.md`: OSO setup and usage details
- `MAINTAINER_RUNBOOK.md`: local/CI operation guide for health reporting

## Scope Rule

- Keep OSO module and health reporting docs here.
- Keep graph-format generation and preview docs in `docs/dependency_graph/`.
