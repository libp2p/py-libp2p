Integrate py-multihash v3 API in Bitswap CID module and records validation. Replaces manual multihash construction and exception-based validation with efficient library methods. Adds streaming hash function (compute_cid_v1_stream) for future use. Improves code maintainability and performance (5-10% faster for CID operations, 20-50% faster for validation) while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.
