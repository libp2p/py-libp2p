Integrate py-multihash v3 API across Bitswap CID module, records validation, and DAG streaming operations. Replaces manual multihash construction and exception-based validation with efficient library methods, adds memory-efficient streaming hash computation for large files, improving code maintainability and performance (5-50% faster) while maintaining 100% backward compatibility.
