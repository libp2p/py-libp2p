Enhanced QUIC Connection ID management with quinn-inspired improvements:
- Added sequence number tracking for proper CID retirement ordering
- Separated initial vs. established CID lookups for better packet routing
- Improved fallback routing from O(n) to O(1) using reverse address mapping
- Refactored Connection ID management into a dedicated ConnectionIDRegistry class

These changes improve robustness, performance, and alignment with proven QUIC implementations.
