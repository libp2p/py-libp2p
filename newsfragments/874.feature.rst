Enhanced Swarm networking with retry logic, exponential backoff, and multi-connection support. Added configurable retry mechanisms that automatically recover from transient connection failures using exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd problems. Introduced connection pooling that allows multiple concurrent connections per peer for improved performance and fault tolerance. Added load balancing across connections and automatic connection health management. All enhancements are fully backward compatible and can be configured through new RetryConfig and ConnectionConfig classes.
