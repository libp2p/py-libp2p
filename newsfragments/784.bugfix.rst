Fixed incorrect handling of raw protobuf format in identify push protocol. The identify push example now properly handles both raw and length-prefixed (varint) message formats, provides better error messages, and displays connection status with peer IDs. Replaced mock-based tests with comprehensive real network integration tests for both formats.
