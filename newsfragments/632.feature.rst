Adds the `StreamState` to the NetStream class to manage the state of network streams more effectively.

**Stream State Management:**
- Implements comprehensive stream lifecycle tracking with states: INIT, OPEN, CLOSE_READ, CLOSE_WRITE, CLOSE_BOTH, RESET, ERROR
- Provides state-based validation to prevent operations on invalid streams (e.g., write-after-close, read-after-reset)
- Replaces lock-based state management with cooperative concurrency for better performance
- Adds intelligent error handling that distinguishes between expected stream exceptions and truly unexpected errors

**ERROR State Implementation:**
- Implements full ERROR state functionality with prevention, triggers, and recovery mechanisms
- Adds `is_operational()` method to check if stream can perform I/O operations
- Adds `recover_from_error()` method to attempt recovery from error state
- Provides comprehensive error state validation across all stream operations

**State Transition Summary and Monitoring:**
- Adds automatic state transition logging for debugging and monitoring
- Implements `get_state_transition_summary()` method for operational status
- Implements `get_valid_transitions()` method to show possible next states
- Implements `get_state_transition_documentation()` for comprehensive state lifecycle info
- Provides developer-friendly state transition visibility and debugging support

**Testing and Quality:**
- Adds 13 dedicated tests for ERROR state functionality covering all scenarios
- Adds 8 additional tests for state transition functionality
- Maintains 100% test coverage with 876+ tests passing
- Resolves all linting issues and maintains code quality standards
- No regressions introduced - all existing functionality preserved

Adds the `remove` method to notify the Swarm that a stream has been removed.
