Enhances the `libp2p`` stack with improved peer connection, relay routing, and discovery for resilient networking.

**Voucher and Signature Verification**
- Implements voucher and signature verification in ``resources.py``
- Validates incoming relay vouchers and signatures to ensure proper authorization
- Prevents misuse of relay resources through secure validation

**Relay Selection Logic**
- Implements initial relay selection logic in ``transport.py``
- Uses basic selection strategies (first-available or round-robin) for relay dialing
- Introduces sophisticated relay selection with scoring, latency-based metrics, and retry strategies

**DHT-based Peer Discovery**
- Implements DHT-based peer discovery using the libp2p DHT
- Enables dynamic location and connection to peers across the network

**Relay Reservation and Maintenance**
- Implements reservation storage and refresh mechanism
- Tracks active relay reservations and refreshes them before expiry
- Supports long-lived relayed connections

**Relay Multiaddr Handling**
- Adds ``/p2p-circuit/...`` addresses to peerstore for reconnects and discovery
- Implements proper parsing and handling of relayed multiaddrs
- Ensures correct validation and usage of ``/p2p-circuit/p2p/...`` paths during dialing

**CircuitV2Listener Implementation**
- Implements ``run()`` method in ``CircuitV2Listener``
- Finalizes listener logic to support incoming relayed connections

**Testing and Quality**
- Adds dedicated tests for voucher and signature verification
- Includes tests for initial and advanced relay selection logic
- Covers DHT-based peer discovery functionality
- Tests reservation storage and refresh mechanisms
- Validates relay multiaddr handling and parsing
- Tests ``CircuitV2Listener`` functionality
- Maintains 100% test coverage across all new features
- Resolves all linting issues and adheres to code quality standards
- Ensures no regressions in existing functionality
