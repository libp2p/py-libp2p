Transport and connection behavior is now driven by capability flags instead of concrete types. Transports can declare ``provides_secure`` and ``provides_muxed``; the swarm skips security and muxer upgrade when both are true (e.g. QUIC). Added ``libp2p.capabilities`` helpers, INFO logs when upgrade is skipped, QUIC listener fix for IPv6 ``getsockname()``, and transport tests for TCP/QUIC capability flags.
