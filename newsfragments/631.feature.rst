Store public key and peer ID in peerstore during handshake

Modified the InsecureTransport class to accept an optional peerstore parameter and updated the handshake process to store the received public key and peer ID in the peerstore when available.

Added test cases to verify:
1. The peerstore remains unchanged when handshake fails due to peer ID mismatch
2. The handshake correctly adds a public key to a peer ID that already exists in the peerstore but doesn't have a public key yet
