Added Gossipsub 2.0 support with enhanced peer scoring, adaptive gossip dissemination, and security features.

This implementation brings py-libp2p to parity with Go and JS libp2p implementations by adding:

- **Enhanced Peer Scoring**: Comprehensive scoring system with P6 (application-specific) and P7 (IP colocation penalty) parameters, decay mechanisms, and behavioral penalties
- **Advanced Message Validation**: Topic-specific validation hooks with caching, timeout mechanisms, and async validator support
- **Adaptive Gossip Dissemination**: Dynamic network parameter adjustment based on network health and peer scores
- **Security Enhancements**: Protection against spam, Sybil, and Eclipse attacks through rate limiting, IP diversity enforcement, and equivocation detection
- **Protocol Negotiation**: Support for ``/meshsub/2.0.0`` protocol with backward compatibility to Gossipsub 1.1/1.2
- **Interoperability**: Full compatibility with existing Go and JS libp2p Gossipsub 2.0 implementations

The new protocol version enables Python-based libp2p applications to participate in modern, secure pubsub networks with improved resilience against adversarial conditions.
