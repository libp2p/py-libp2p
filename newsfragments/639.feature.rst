Fixed several flow-control and concurrency issues in the ``YamuxStream`` class. Previously, stress-testing revealed that transferring data over ``DEFAULT_WINDOW_SIZE`` would break the stream due to inconsistent window update handling and lock management. The fixes include:

- Removed sending of window updates during writes to maintain correct flow-control.
- Added proper timeout handling when releasing and acquiring locks to prevent concurrency errors.
- Corrected the ``read`` function to properly handle window updates for both ``read_until_EOF`` and ``read_n_bytes``.
- Added event logging at ``send_window_updates`` and ``waiting_for_window_updates`` for better observability.
