- Added a lightweight peer reputation tracker for Kademlia lookups so network
  searches prefer reliable peers without external dependencies.
- Introduced an optional adaptive GossipSub tuner that tweaks mesh degree,
  heartbeat interval, and PX peers based on live heartbeat metrics.
- Extended the chat demo with an optional AI assistant that can summarize
  conversations or auto-reply using transformers (when installed) or
  heuristic fallbacks.
- Added predictive heuristics for relay/AutoNAT: a new reachability predictor
  now guides DCUtR hole-punch attempts and the AutoNAT service surfaces a
  confidence-backed status classification.
- Introduced a pubsub anomaly detector that tracks per-peer publish/control
  rates, automatically blacklisting statistical outliers to mitigate spam.
