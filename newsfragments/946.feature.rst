Added persistent peer storage system with datastore-agnostic backend support.

The new PersistentPeerStore implementation provides persistent storage for peer data
(addresses, keys, metadata, protocols, latency metrics) across application restarts.
This addresses the limitation of the in-memory peerstore that loses all peer information
when the process restarts.

Key features:
- Datastore-agnostic interface supporting multiple backends (SQLite, LevelDB, RocksDB, Memory)
- Full compatibility with existing IPeerStore interface
- Automatic persistence of all PeerData fields including last_identified, ttl, and latmap
- Factory functions for easy creation with different backends
- Comprehensive test suite and usage examples

The implementation follows the same architectural pattern as go-libp2p's pstoreds package,
providing a robust foundation for long-running libp2p applications that need to maintain
peer information across restarts.
