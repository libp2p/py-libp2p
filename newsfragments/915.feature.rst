Add comprehensive connection health monitoring and intelligent load balancing to libp2p.

**Connection Health Metrics:**
- Implements ConnectionHealth dataclass with latency tracking, success rates, bandwidth monitoring, and error history
- Provides weighted health scoring algorithm with configurable weights (latency, success rate, stability)
- Tracks connection age, idle time, stream lifecycle, and performance trends
- Monitors bandwidth usage with time-windowed tracking and peak/average calculations

**Proactive Monitoring Service:**
- Implements ConnectionHealthMonitor service with periodic health checks and automatic connection replacement
- Performs non-intrusive ping-based health verification with configurable intervals
- Supports warmup windows and grace periods to prevent premature connection replacement
- Automatically maintains minimum connection count per peer while replacing unhealthy connections

**Health-Aware Load Balancing:**
- Adds four connection selection strategies: round_robin, least_loaded, health_based, and latency_based
- Routes traffic to healthiest/lowest-latency connections for optimal performance
- Provides fallback behavior when health data unavailable

**API Consistency Fix:**
- Extends new_host() to accept connection_config parameter, resolving previous API inconsistency
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing code
- Supports health monitoring configuration through high-level host API
- Properly merges health settings with QUIC transport configuration when both are provided

**Configuration and Integration:**
- Adds comprehensive ConnectionConfig options for health monitoring customization
- Integrates health tracking throughout connection lifecycle (establishment, usage, closure)
- Provides health summary and metrics export through host interface
- Includes extensive test coverage with 80+ new tests covering all components
