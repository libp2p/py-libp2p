Added a comprehensive NAT traversal example demonstrating Circuit Relay v2, DCUtR (Direct Connection Upgrade through Relay), and AutoNAT protocols.

The example includes three scripts in ``examples/nat/``:
- ``relay.py``: A publicly reachable relay node that facilitates connections between NATed peers
- ``listener.py``: A NATed peer that advertises via relay and accepts incoming connections
- ``dialer.py``: A NATed peer that connects through relay and attempts DCUtR hole punching to establish direct connections

This example demonstrates how two NATed peers can establish communication through a relay and automatically upgrade to a direct connection when possible, while using AutoNAT to detect and report network reachability status.
