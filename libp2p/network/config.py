class RetryConfig:
    """
    Configuration for retry logic with exponential backoff.

    This configuration controls how connection attempts are retried when they fail.
    The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering
    herd problems in distributed systems.

    Attributes:
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts before giving up.
                     Default: 3 attempts
        initial_delay: Initial delay in seconds before the first retry.
                      Default: 0.1 seconds (100ms)
        max_delay: Maximum delay cap in seconds to prevent excessive wait times.
                  Default: 30.0 seconds
        backoff_multiplier: Multiplier for exponential backoff (each retry multiplies
                           the delay by this factor). Default: 2.0 (doubles each time)
        jitter_factor: Random jitter factor (0.0-1.0) to add randomness to delays
                      and prevent synchronized retries. Default: 0.1 (10% jitter)

    Configuration for multi-connection support with health monitoring.

    This configuration controls how multiple connections per peer are managed,
    including connection limits, timeouts, load balancing strategies, and
    connection health monitoring capabilities.

    Attributes:
        max_connections_per_peer: Maximum number of connections allowed to a single
                                 peer. Default: 3 connections

                                 Default: False
        health_check_interval: Interval between health checks in seconds.
                              Default: 60.0
        ping_timeout: Timeout for ping operations in seconds. Default: 5.0
        min_health_threshold: Minimum health score (0.0-1.0) for connections.
                             Default: 0.3
        min_connections_per_peer: Minimum connections to maintain per peer.
