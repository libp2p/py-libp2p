    """
    Configuration for retry logic with exponential backoff.

    This configuration controls how connection attempts are retried when they fail.
    The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering
    herd problems in distributed systems.

    Attributes:
        max_retries: Maximum number of retry attempts before giving up.
                     Default: 3 attempts
        initial_delay: Initial delay in seconds before the first retry.
                      Default: 0.1 seconds (100ms)
        max_delay: Maximum delay cap in seconds to prevent excessive wait times.
                  Default: 30.0 seconds
        backoff_multiplier: Multiplier for exponential backoff (each retry multiplies
                           the delay by this factor). Default: 2.0 (doubles each time)
        jitter_factor: Random jitter factor (0.0-1.0) to add randomness to delays
                      and prevent synchronized retries. Default: 0.1 (10% jitter)

    Configuration for connection management matching JS libp2p behavior.

    This configuration controls connection limits, timeouts, rate limiting,
    security, and queue management for libp2p connections.

    Attributes:
        max_connections: Maximum total connections (inbound + outbound).
                         Default: 300
        max_connections_per_peer: Maximum number of connections allowed to a single

        dial_timeout: Timeout in seconds for establishing dial connections
                     (including DNS resolution). Default: 10.0
        connection_close_timeout: Timeout in seconds for closing connections.
                                 Default: 1.0
        inbound_upgrade_timeout: Timeout in seconds for inbound connection upgrades.
                                Default: 10.0
        outbound_upgrade_timeout: Timeout in seconds for outbound connection upgrades
                                 (security and muxer negotiation). Default: 10.0
        outbound_stream_protocol_negotiation_timeout: Timeout in seconds for
            outbound stream protocol negotiation. Default: 10.0
        inbound_stream_protocol_negotiation_timeout: Timeout in seconds for
            inbound stream protocol negotiation. Default: 10.0
        connection_timeout: Legacy timeout - use dial_timeout instead.
                           Default: 30.0 (kept for backward compatibility)
        load_balancing_strategy: Strategy for distributing streams across connections.
                                Options: "round_robin" (default) or "least_loaded"
        inbound_connection_threshold: Maximum connections per second from a single
                                      host. Default: 5
        reconnect_retries: Number of reconnection attempts for KEEP_ALIVE peers.

                   to connect, even if max_connections is reached.
        deny_list: List of IP addresses/networks (CIDR) that are never allowed
                  to connect.
